									<h2><a href="#">My name is James Klau</a></h2>
									<p>This portfolio showcases some of the projects I have created in Power BI throughout the years. I am extremely passionate about data 
										and data visualization. My strengths include analyzing business procedures and problems to define data, creating data structures and algorithms, and extracting
										data from databases. The purpose of data is to tell a story and it takes extensive experience to uncover that story.

								<ul class="actions special">
									<li><p>This dashboard strives to compare productivity among teams in a company. Over 30 metrics are calculated 
										from various sources. Using this dashboard I have gained valuable inter-personal and communication skills by
										setting up meetings to better understand each division and employee at my current job. Division's definition of 
										productivity can vary greatly and thus working closely with management proved to be essential for this project.
